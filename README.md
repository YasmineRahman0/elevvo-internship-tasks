Elevvo Internship – Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at Elevvo Pathways. Each project gave me hands-on experience with real-world data and enhanced my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

📌 Projects Completed

🔹 Student Score Prediction

Built a regression model to analyze key factors influencing student performance.

Predicted exam scores based on study hours and other features.

🔹 Customer Segmentation

Applied clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers.

Segmentation was based on income and spending behavior for targeted marketing.

🔹 Forest Cover Type Classification

Designed a multi-class classification model.

Used cartographic and environmental features to predict forest cover types.

🔹 Loan Approval Prediction

Developed a predictive system to determine loan eligibility.

Applied classification models to analyze applicant and financial details.

🔹 Sales Forecasting

Implemented time-series forecasting models.

Predicted future Walmart sales trends using historical sales data.

🔹 Traffic Sign Recognition

Trained a deep learning CNN model to classify traffic signs.

Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization) and achieved robust recognition.
